Downloaded Image Viewer (P1 - Assignment 1)


Overview of the Downloaded Image Viewer Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Android to develop an app that contains a MainActivity that prompts the user for a URL to an image and then uses Intents and the DownloadImageActivity to download the image and view it via the Gallery app. The DownloadImageActivity should use the Android "HaMeR" concurrency framework, which is covered in this video. 



In addition to the lectures on Android we'll present in class during Weeks 1 and 2, the following resources may be helpful in completing portions of this assignment: 
• Introduction to Android Concurrency 
• Motivations for Concurrency 


Skeleton Code

Skeleton code for this assignment is available here. Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers. 

Note that there are no automated unit tests for this assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can successfully download and view an image. Make sure that your program works properly for both valid and invalid URLs entered by the user. 


Concluding Remarks

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with concurrent programming Android in Java. Make sure you start early and come to Virtual Office Hours if you have questions or run into problems.
